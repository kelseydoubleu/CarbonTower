# How Buildings Breathe

An interactive tower simulation that visualizes how different building materials affect carbon particle behavior and atmospheric exchange.

## What it does

Switch between different building materials on a single tower and watch how carbon particles react in real-time. Each material—concrete, timber, hempcrete, etc.—has distinct carbon sequestration, emission, and circulation properties that become visible through particle animation.

The visualization makes abstract material carbon impact tangible: some materials trap carbon, others release it, some enable flow. It's a pedagogical tool that shows "breathing" isn't metaphorical—buildings actually exchange carbon with their environment based on material choices.

## Context

Part of the "Carbon Capital" thesis at Columbia GSAPP. This tool bridges material science and spatial experience, helping non-technical audiences understand why material selection fundamentally shapes a building's carbon relationship with its surroundings.

## Tech

Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript with particle system animation

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a browser or visit the [live demo](https://kelseydoubleu.github.io/CarbonTower/). Desktop recommended for optimal interaction.
